    <h2>Every day is a new start</h2>
    <p>At some point every to-do app starts to make me feel bad. All those unfinished tasks that once I really waned to work on, but never found the time for. It's so hard to let go... ðŸ˜ž</p>
    <p>I found that a very simple but effective trick helped me stick to planning without all the guilt: <strong>start every day with a clean slate</strong>. I've been using this every day for the past 2 years and I've been more productive than ever ðŸ’ª with great results at work and more chores done around the house.</p>
    <p>Today I'm sharing it with you ðŸ‘ˆ, hoping it will also help you stick to planning your work and make you feel good in the process. I initially built this for myself, so it has some rough edges, though it's still very efficient </p>
    <h2>Get started</h2>
