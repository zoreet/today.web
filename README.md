Web based Todo list where every day is a new start.

## The customer problem
I found myself constantly switching to the newest todo list, just because it offered me a fresh start, setting me free from all the tasks that once I enthusiastically added, but now only serve the purpose of shaming me.

I needed an app that would help me go over the emotional struggle of letting go of something interesting but not important.

The solution that is helping me since October 2016 is to start every day with a clean slate. If I still want to work on that thing from yesterday, I have to manually move it myself. Each and every one. This small inconvenience proved to be a valuable incentive for me to focus and allowed me to get more things done that I ever did, all while learning to be a father.

## The technical challenge
Just building a todo list is simple and has been overdone. To make it fun, and to channel my frustration with the ever more complicated js environment, I decided to prove that we can still build a working js app that uses as little code as possible ( no React, Redux, Webpack, web assembly and all of that) but still has great customer features like:
- code formating
- multiple users
- sync across devices

##Further cutting down
Get rid of jQuery - I'm sorry pal, but it's time
Get rid of moment.js, or remove all the things I don't need. That I'm not looking forward to :D
